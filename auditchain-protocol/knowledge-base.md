# Knowledge Base

## About This Volume

This knowledge base is under constant upgrades and improvements. It is the evolution of many years of study and practice.&#x20;

Pacioli.ai is a decentralized version of proven methods and applications using global standards for the computation and articulation of changes in state for economic entities.&#x20;

You are free to use any of the controls in the financial reporting schemes below as they are open source. We make no representation on the functional objective of these controls and give no warranties.



## Accounting, Reporting, Auditing, and Analysis in a Digital Environment

### Theory, Framework, Method, Principles

What is conspicuously lacking in most people's mind is a broad framework let alone a theory on how to think about digital financial reporting. We provide that framework and theory.

### Financial Reporting Schemes

Human-readable and machine-readable financial [reporting schemes](http://accounting.auditchain.finance/reporting-scheme/index.html) are implemented using the good practices method. This machine readable metadata is used within the [Luca Suite](https://docs.auditchain.finance/luca-suite/overview-of-luca-suite) and the [Pacioli logic and Reasoning Engine](https://docs.auditchain.finance/pacioli/pacioli-logic-and-rules-engine) to constrain rules-based artificial intelligence for articulating financial and operational state.
